This tutorial is intended for a beginner planning to Learn React and Grommet.

Here, I have tried to explain each concepts using Code Examples.
Reader should go in following order.

1. [React HelloWorld](https://github.com/zahid7292/react-examples/tree/master/react-helloworld)
2. [React Basic](https://github.com/zahid7292/react-examples/tree/master/react-basic)
3. [React Router](https://github.com/zahid7292/react-examples/tree/master/router)
4. [Flux](https://github.com/zahid7292/react-examples/tree/master/flux)
5. [Redux](https://github.com/zahid7292/react-examples/tree/master/router)


Each module is a working application. For running any of them, Follow these steps.

1. Go to root directory of module and open command prompt in that directory.
2. run command `npm install`
3. Then run command `npm run dev`

It will start server listening to port: 8080 with hot reloading enabled
(Meaning any changes made in your javascript file will be reflected immediately)
4. If you want to build the app. run command `npm build`. It will create index.bundle.js file inside 'src' Directory which can be used anywhere.

There is also a presentation file Available which can found from [here](https://github.com/zahid7292/tutorial)
