Each module is a working application. For running any of them, Follow these steps.

1. Go to root directory of module and open command prompt in that directory.
2. run command `npm install`
3. Then run command `npm run dev`
It will start server listening to port: 8080 with hot reloading enabled
(Meaning any changes made in your javascript file will be reflected immediately)
4. If you want to build the app. run command `npm build`. It will create index.bundle.js file inside 'src' Directory which can be used anywhere.
